For this month's release, we've:
- Added support for Image Playgrounds! Use it to add images to your posts, generate a featured image, or site icon.
- Added undo and redo to the experimental editor (have you tried the editor yet? if not, you should!)
- Made the Gravatar Quick Editor a bit nicer.
- Added a shortcut for changing the featured image for a post.
- Improved how images in your media library are displayed â€“ it should be a little nicer now.
- Done the usual bug fixes and performance improvements (mostly in the editor)
