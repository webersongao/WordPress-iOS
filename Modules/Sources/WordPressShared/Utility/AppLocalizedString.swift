/// Use this function instead of `NSLocalizedString` to reference localized strings **from the app bundle** – especially
/// when using localized strings from the code of an app extension.
///
/// You should use this `AppLocalizedString` method in place of `NSLocalizedString` especially when calling it
/// from App Extensions and Widgets, in order to reference strings whose localization live in the app bundle's `.strings` file
/// (rather than the AppExtension's own bundle).
///
/// In order to avoid duplicating our strings accross targets, and make our localization process & tooling easier, we keep all
/// localized `.strings` in the app's bundle (and don't have a `.strings` file in the App Extension targets themselves);
/// then we make those App Extensions & Widgets reference the strings from the `Localizable.strings` files
/// hosted in the app bundle itself – which is when this helper method is helpful.
///
/// - Note:
///   Tooling: Be sure to pass this function's name as a custom routine when parsing the code to generate the main `.strings` file,
///   using `genstrings -s AppLocalizedString`, so that this helper method is recognized. You will also have to
///   exclude this very file from being parsed by `genstrings`, so that it won't accidentally misinterpret that routine/function definition
///   below as a call site and generate an error because of it.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - key: An identifying value used to reference a localized string.
///   - tableName: The basename of the `.strings` file **in the app bundle** containing
///     the localized values. If `tableName` is `nil`, the `Localizable` table is used.
///   - value: The English/default copy for the string. This is the user-visible string that the
///     translators will use as original to translate, and also the string returned when the localized string for
///     `key` cannot be found in the table. If `value` is `nil` or empty, `key` would be returned instead.
///   - comment: A note to the translator describing the context where the localized string is presented to the user.
///
/// - Returns: A localized version of the string designated by `key` in the table identified by `tableName`.
///   If the localized string for `key` cannot be found within the table, `value` is returned.
///   (However, `key` is returned instead when `value` is `nil` or the empty string).
